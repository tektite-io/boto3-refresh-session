## What is boto3-refresh-session?

boto3-refresh-session is a simple Python package with a drop-in replacement for [boto3.Session](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/core/session.html#boto3.session.Session) named [RefreshableSession](https://61418.io/boto3-refresh-session/api/generated/boto3_refresh_session.session.RefreshableSession.html#boto3_refresh_session.session.RefreshableSession). It automatically refreshes temporary AWS credentials, [caches clients](https://61418.io/boto3-refresh-session/usage.html#client-caching), and [supports MFA token providers](https://61418.io/boto3-refresh-session/usage.html#mfa). It supports automatic temporary AWS security credential refresh for STS, IOT Core, and custom credential callables. And it is [thoroughly tested](https://github.com/michaelthomasletts/boto3-refresh-session/tree/main/tests), [regularly updated](https://github.com/michaelthomasletts/boto3-refresh-session/commits/main/), [comprehensively documentated](https://michaelthomasletts.github.io/boto3-refresh-session/index.html), and [published to PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/boto3-refresh-session/).

boto3-refresh-session was authored by [Mike Letts](https://github.com/michaelthomasletts) and is maintained by [61418](https://github.com/61418).

## Why it exists

Although boto3 already supports automatic temporary credential refresh via role assumption as configured in ``~/.aws/config``, there are 
scenarios and edge cases where that is insufficient. Below are just a *few* examples:

- Profiles or configs are unavailable or impractical (e.g., containerized or serverless environments)
- You need to explicitly assume roles in a program (not profiles or configs) and hand those credentials around without worrying about expiration
- Custom credential providers are required (e.g. IOT, external ID, etc.)

boto3-refresh-session exists to fill those gaps (and others not listed) while maintaining full compatibility with boto3.

Although there are other open source tools available which address automatic temporary AWS credential refresh, boto3-refresh-session is ergonomically designed to feel like an _extension_ of boto3 (with a few extra parameters) rather than a separate library with a completely unfamiliar API. Using boto3-refresh-session, you can initialize service clients, resources, collections, etc. from `RefreshableSession` exactly like you would in boto3. More, the available alternatives to boto3-refresh-session do not support the _breadth_ of features that boto3-refresh-session does, such as client caching, MFA token provider support, or IoT Core X.509 credential refresh, among others. Even if you don't need boto3-refresh-session's core feature (automatic temporary AWS credential refresh), the client caching feature may still be useful to you.

## Recognition and testimonials

[Featured in TL;DR Sec.](https://tldrsec.com/p/tldr-sec-282)

[Featured in CloudSecList.](https://cloudseclist.com/issues/issue-290)

A testimonial from an engineer at Netflix:

> _Most of my work is on tooling related to AWS security, so I'm pretty choosy about boto3 credentials-adjacent code. I often opt to just write this sort of thing myself so I at least know that I can reason about it. But I found boto3-refresh-session to be very clean and intuitive [...] We're using AWS Lambda to perform lots of operations across several regions in hundreds of accounts, over and over again, all day every day. And it turns out that there's a surprising amount of overhead to creating boto3 clients (mostly deserializing service definition json), so we can run MUCH more efficiently if we keep a cache of clients, all equipped with automatically refreshing sessions._

## Installation
